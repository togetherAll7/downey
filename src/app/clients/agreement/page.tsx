                        planning minimum due at contract signing. This payment
                        will be considered a deposit to hold your date on the
                        calendar. Payment of the remaining contract amount is
                        due one month prior to your wedding date. Please make

                        Please note that no date will be held and services will
                        not begin until a signed contract and deposit are
                        received.
                      </p>
                      <h2>PRICING DETAILS</h2>
                      <p>
                        The following contract amount includes all professional
                        services as described in this proposal. If chosen venue
                        is within 100 miles of San Francisco, a flat travel fee
                        of $1,500 / day will apply when (1) the venue is 25
                        miles or more from San Francisco (pre and post wedding);
                        (2) the wedding ends at midnight or later; or (3) when
                        Downey Street Events is planning multiple events across
                        more than one day (including supervising load in and
                        load out of rentals). If chosen location is more than
                        100 miles from San Francisco, travel fees will be billed
                        separately and include reimbursement for flights or
                        mileage, hotel stays, and a $100/day per diem per person
                        from Downey Street Events for each trip to chosen
                        location. Downey Street Events will use local staff
                        whenever possible. Travel fees will be billed separately
                        and are not included in the total below.
                      </p>
                      <h2>REFUND POLICY</h2>
                      <p>
                        Your deposit is non-refundable. Should the event be
                        canceled or postponed between 260 and 180 days of the
                        event date, 50% of the final payment will be billed /
                        owed. Should the event be canceled or postponed at any
                        other time, 100% of any money owed to Downey Street
                        Events will be billed / owed. Should there come a time
                        when Downey Street Events is unable to continue
                        performing the specified tasks outlined in this
                        contract, Downey Street Events will find a replacement
                        planner. If a replacement planner cannot be provided,
                        Downey Street Events will refund any money paid to
                        Downey Street Events less fees for work already
                        performed. Fees for work already performed will be
                        calculated as 10% of the total contract price per month
                        of work performed (For example, if Downey Street Events
                        has performed 2 months of work it will retain 20% of the
                        total contracted amount).
                      </p>
                      <h2>COVID-19</h2>
                      <p>
                        Downey Street Events may, in its sole discretion, choose
                        to not work an event due to risks associated with
                        COVID-19. The foregoing shall apply even if the event
                        complies with government allowances if Downey Street
                        Events feels that its staff is not appropriately
                        safeguarded.
